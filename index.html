    <h2>Using the console Log</h2>
    <h3 class="heading3">definition</h3>
    <p class="definition">console log is used for debugging purposes in the browser environment. It display information in the console box of the browser window.</p>

    <h2>Variables in JavaScript</h2>
    <h3 class='heading3'>definition</h3>
    <p>Variables in JavaScript are containers for storing data values. They are declared using var, let, or const keywords. Variables can hold various types of data such as numbers, strings, arrays, objects, or functions. They allow dynamic manipulation and referencing of data within a program.</p>
    <h3>Syntax for declaring the variables</h3>
    <p>you can declare the variables with var, let and const keywords. for example
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 20px; color: hotpink;">var name = "my name is jai"</span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 20px; color: hotpink;">let name = "my name is jai"</span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 20px; color: hotpink;">const name = "my name is jai"</span>
    </p>
    <h3>How to use</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use const for variables that should not be reassigned after initialization. This enhances code readability and prevents accidental reassignments.</li>
        <li>Use let for variables that need to be reassigned within their block scope. This promotes better code structure and reduces potential bugs related to variable reassignments.</li>
        <li>Use var sparingly, as it has function scope and can lead to unintended variable hoisting and redeclaration issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Note:</b>In modern JavaScript, let and const are preferred due to their block scoping behavior and stricter rules, which help in writing more maintainable and predictable code.</p>
