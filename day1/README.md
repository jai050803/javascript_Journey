## Javascript Introduction

##### Key points about javascript

- JavaScript is an interpreted, client-side, event-based, object-oriented scripting language that you can use to add dynamic interactivity to your web pages. 

- You can use JavaScript to achieve many tasks in web development and other development tasks as well

- Create special effects with images that give the impression that a button is either highlighted or depressed whenever the mouse pointer is hovered over it.

- Validate information that users enter into your web forms

- Open pages in new windows, and customise the appearance of those new windows.

- Detect the capabilities of the user’s browser and alter your page’s content appropriately.

- Event-based refers to JavaScript’s ability to run certain bits of code only when a specified event occurs. An event could be the page being loaded, a form being submitted, a link being clicked, or an image being pointed at by a mouse pointer.

- Object-oriented signals that JavaScript’s power to exert control over an HTML page is based on manipulating objects within that page.
