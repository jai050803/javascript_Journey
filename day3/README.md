# looping in the javascript

- loops are important concept in any programming language as they made the code easy and understandable.

- THere are three types of loops in the javascript namely - For loop, while loop and the do while loop.

- The usage of all the loops are different from one another.

- the letters i j and k are traditionally used by programmers to initialize the variables in the loops.

- in order to achieve a counting effect, we use the increament and the decreament operators with the variables.

- the counting in the javascript begins with zero.

### For loop

-the syntax for the for loop is -

for(i =1; i <=100; i++){
    document.write(i)
}

- the above code will print the first 100 numbers. It works as follows 

- first we set the value of our variable i as 1. so it starts with 100 and then will increament the variable i with 1 till it is not less than or equal to 100. once it becomes 101, the loop breaks and the program stops.

### While loop

- while  loop execute the statement inside it till the given condition is true.

the syntax for the while loop is as follows..

while(condition)
    statement

- in while loop it is important to notice that the condition becomes false at some point of time. if the condition remains true then it leads to infinite loops.

### Labelled statement

- a label provides a statement with an identifer that lets you refer to it elsewhere in your program.

- for example, you use a label to identify a loop, then you use the break or continue statements to indicate whether a program should interrupt the loop or continue its execution.
